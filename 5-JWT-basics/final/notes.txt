JWT - JSON Web Token

if a valid token is present in the request, the user can access specific info

for restricted routes - like dashboard - if the token is not present, or not valid, then the server 
will respond with an error and this is how we can restrict access to certain routes/resources


big picture steps
- check username, password in post(login) request
- if it exists, create new JWT on server and send to client
- setup authentication so only the request with JWT can access the dashboard
