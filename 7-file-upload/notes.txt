You can upload files through postman by doing the following:
- In body tab, choose 'form data'
- Change the key to 'file'
- Enter the name of the file
- Then choose the file from your local computer

Use express-fileupload to store files on the server, then access the uploaded files as these files are not available by default.

Then you can store the files on a server (cloudinary for example)

Then send back a response with a correct path (path of the file) on the server

Then when you upload the file from the client, you access the image src from - 

  "image": {
        "src": "/uploads/computer-1.jpeg"
    }
  
the above payload is the response from uploading the file to /products/uploads
the front end will listen to any changes in the input, and when there's a new image added, it will send a 
post request to /products/uploads endpoint which will return the payload
then the front end will use the src property as part of the req.body when adding the product - i.e., when submit button is clicked. this will make a post call to /products

which gives you access to the image stored on the server. This means, in this project's case, the body can have
{
  "name": "product name",
  "price": "400.99",
  "img": "computer-1.jpeg" <-- this will be used to find the image on the server
}

And since we've made the image publicly available, we can access them here - http://localhost:4000/uploads/computer-1.jpeg (using computer-1.jpeg for example)

*Note: files are different from req.body where json is being sent
